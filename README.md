# Search.API

A small web-based application to perform search by keywords in "well known" search engine and analises position of the website you are intersted in. The application prompts for a string of keywords to search, and a URL to find in the search results. The input values are then processed to return a string of numbers for where the URL is found in the search engineâ€™s results.
For example, "1, 10, 33" or "0".
It analises URLs appeared in the first 50 results.

Special requirements are:
  * **No 3rd party libraries for scraping the HTML pages** otherwise I would use google/bing api or Html Agility Pack to parse html
  * Ajax calls
  * DI
  * Logging 
  * Unit tests
  * SOLID principles
  * Uses httpClientFactory to instantiate httpclient
